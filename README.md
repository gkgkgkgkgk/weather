I have focused mainly on the functionality, just to make it work with the third party libraries. Didn't do TDD or any unit tests.

mvn clean install - will create WeatherSite.war file, deploy onto tomcat with 1.8 JRE

use these URL to access the application

http://localhost:8080/WeatherSite

Please also note that logging, validation and exception handling are not done/complete for this excercise
